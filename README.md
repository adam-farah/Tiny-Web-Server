# Tiny-Web-Server
A static file webserver in node.js that has no dependencies outside of the core node.js modules.


To run it, just type "node tinywebserver.js". 
It will begin serving on the web the pages in the same directory as the script. 
You'll want to have some files files to serve; to start off, try having it serve hello.html from class. 
Then, move on to saving pages from the web and serving those. 
(Note: they probably will be broken in some way by tinywebserver.)
